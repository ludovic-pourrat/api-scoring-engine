# API Scoring Engine

## Overview
API Scoring Engine is a powerful tool designed to evaluate APIs against key industry standards and best practices. It provides structured scoring mechanisms to help developers, security teams, and architects assess API quality, security, and readiness.

## Features
This engine scores APIs based on the following criteria:

- **OWASP Top 10 Security Risks**: Assesses API security against the latest OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Developer Experience**: Evaluates API usability, documentation quality, and ease of integration.
- **Mocking Readiness**: Determines how well the API supports mocking for testing and development purposes.
- **API Standard Conformance**: Checks adherence to common API design standards (e.g., RESTful best practices, OpenAPI compliance).

## Endpoints
The API Scoring Engine exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /score`
  - **Purpose**: Scores an API.
  - **Input**: API specification (OpenAPI, Swagger, or JSON schema).
  - **Output**: A detailed compliance score with improvement recommendations.

Categories

 - OWASP Top 10
 - Developer experience
 - Mocking readiness
 - URL versioning
 - Conformance to the respective standard

## Use Cases
- **Security teams**: Evaluate API security risks and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Developers**: Improve API design and usability before deployment.
- **Platform architects**: Ensure APIs align with organizational best practices.
- **QA teams**: Verify API readiness for testing and mocking environments.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for GraphQL and gRPC APIs.
- Automated API scanning and continuous compliance monitoring.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for real-time API assessment.
